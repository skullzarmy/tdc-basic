# TDC Hodlers Dashboard

## **DEPRECATED**
I have decided to leave this repo in place as-is for anyone that may want to use it as a basic starting point, but I have restarted this project from scratch in SvelteKit and decided it belonged in a new repo. I also decided to make the new repo private. This repo will no longer receive any updates.

The new dashboard is hosted via Netlify and can be viewed at
